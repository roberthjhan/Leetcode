Problem
A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of
every member of the collection. We say that a common substring
is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer
common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of
"ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as long as possible;
in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT"
and "AACCGTATA".

Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique;
for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common
substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1
kbp each in FASTA format.

Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple
solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)

Comments:

This solution iterates through every possible substring in each sequence.
A better solution might only check the substrings in the first sequence
then check the other sequences to see if it is common to all.

This solution also starts with the smallest substrings. A better solution
implementing the better algorithm would start with the largest substrings
then return the first one found.
